## How to use the project
The project folder is divided into two folders, mainly **backend** and **frontend**. The backend folder contains several folders. The app folder contains the models and controllers for the backend. It also has a db folder that contains the active record migrations together with the seed files.

The **frontend** contains several necessary folders. **public** contains the main index file that all the app runs from. The **src** folder contains the **components** folder that holds all the components running our SPA. We also have a CSS folder that holds **SASS** files ment for styling our components.
